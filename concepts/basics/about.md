# About

[ABAP][abap] is a programming language developed by SAP for the development of business applications with the ABAP development environment of an ABAP Platform.

ABAP supports the following:

- An object-oriented programming model that is based on classes and interfaces of ABAP Objects.
- A procedural programming model that is based on function modules and subroutines.

Both models are interoperable, however, on Exercism the focus is solely on the object-oriented programming model.

You can find more information in the [ABAP Track][docs] documentation.
