# Recommended Learning Resources

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning ABAP for the first time. These free resources can help you get started:

* SAP Learning Journey [Get Started with ABAP Programming](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/get-started-with-abap-programming-on-sap-btp)
* [ABAP for Newbies Community](https://community.sap.com/topics/abap/abap-for-newbies)
* [ABAP Language Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm)

If you are completely new to ABAP, we recommend completing the first two units of the SAP Learning Journey. After that, you will be ready to solve ABAP exercises on Exercism.
