## Troubleshooting

- In case of connection issues, check [SSL Setup](https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/setup/ssl-setup.html)
- In case of error `Package $EXERCISM_DIFFERENCE-OF-SQUARES exceeds ABAP 30-characters name limit`, please use a shorter package name like `$exer`.
- Some files will show diffs after pulling into your ABAP system. Differences related to end-of-file characters or byte-order-marks can be ignored.
