# Description

Fizz Buzz is allegedly originally a childrens game to practice division, with some simple rules.
The first player starts by saying the number 1 and players then take turn counting upwards one number at a time, but:

If a number is evenly divisable by 3, the player instead says 'Fizz'
If a number is evenly divisable by 5, the player instead says 'Buzz'
If a number is evenly divisable by both 3 and 5, the player says 'FizzBuzz'
So, it would start like this:
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz

Fill the string table with 100 Fizz Buzz values.
